# Log Analysis script using python

I have done this script completely in python to parse and analyze logs.

- Log_Parser_Analysis
  
    - log_parser
    - count_requests_using_ip
    - most_frequently_accessed_endpoint
    - detect_suspicious_activity
    - write_to_csv

In sample.log, I have generated for more than 100 lines along with the given sample using llama2, to check test cases more effectively.

### Modules used

- re (regular expressions)
- csv (write csv files)
